/**
 * A Sprite is an object, created by a Renderer, which represents a 2D object.
 * It may have an enter callback, an update callback, an exit callback,
 * or any combination. The Renderer will invoke these callbacks in order,
 * passing in a SpriteView which the caller can use to modify values.
 *
 * The Sprite goes through three states:
 *
 *  - Created - Sprite exists, but has not been allocated a swatch of memory.
 *  - Active - Sprite has been allocated a swatch and is renderable.
 *  - Removed - Any resources the Sprite was allocated have been reclaimed.
 *
 * In many cases, the Sprite will advance directly from Created to Active at
 * creation time. However, at scale, a Sprite may stay in the Created state
 * waiting for memory to become available.
 *
 * Calling the Sprite's exit() method signals the intent to move from Active to
 * Removed. This transition does not necessarily happen immediately. Once the
 * Renderer has invoked the exit callback, and after enough time has elapsed to
 * complete the transition, then the Renderer will remove the Sprite from active
 * use and set its state to Removed. In the Removed state, the Sprite object
 * still exists, but its isRemoved property will return true, and the Renderer
 * will no longer maintain any reference to it.
 *
 * Once an exit callback has been set, the Sprite is marked for eventual
 * removal. Setting enter or update callbacks after this will not change the
 * fact that the Sprite is to be removed. However, those late-added callbacks
 * WILL be invoked.
 *
 * After the Sprite has been removed from use, additional calls to its enter(),
 * update() or exit() methods will throw an Error.
 *
 * In some cases, a Sprite in the Created state may no longer be needed. For
 * example, a Selection may create more Sprites than are renderable such that
 * only some are Active and the rest wait in the Created state. If a later call
 * to that Selection's bind() method reduces the number of Sprites, some of
 * those in the Created state may no longer be necessary.
 *
 * In cases where the Sprite was in the Created state but is no longer needed
 * (and therefore should never render), use its abandon() method to mark it for
 * immediate removal. Once a Sprite is abandoned, its callbacks will be cleared
 * and any attempts to set them will throw Errors.
